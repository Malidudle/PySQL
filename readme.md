# SQLite Clone

A SQLite clone implementation in Python, focusing on core database functionality including B+ trees for indexing and SQL command parsing.

## Acknowledgments

This project was built with the help of the following educational resources:

- [How Do Databases Work? | Interview Pen](https://youtu.be/FnsIJAaGRk4) - Part 1 of the SQLite clone tutorial series
- [Understanding B-Trees: The Data Structure Behind Modern Databases | Spanning Tree](https://youtu.be/K1a2Bk8NrYQ) - Part 3 on SQL command parsing

These videos provided valuable insights into database internals and guided the implementation of key features in this project.
